    <h2>Ryker Davison</h2>
    <h2>SwampDonkey249</h2>
    <p>Hows it going yall? I'm married to my wife Lindsay and two months ago she gave me my son Kade. I grew up in Montana but have lived all over the U.S. I served in the military from 2012-2016 and the only reason I'm in college is because of the G.I. Bill.</p>
    <p>My major is business supply chain and I'm hoping after I graduate next year that I will be able to get into sourcing for a career. I'm one of those people who are up to do anything fun. Love to snowboard, love camping, and I love hockey.</p>
