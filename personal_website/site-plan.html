        [Hello, My Name is Ryker Davison and I am an Afghanistan veteran that is now going to school. I have always had an idea in my head about creating a t-shirt business. I know that there is already a bunch of Veteran owned and ran businesses that sells clothing. But I was thinking maybe I could bridge the gap between vet and civilians and just provide a fun and funny experience for everyone to enjoy. Lately it seems no matter what you do, you are somehow going to offend somebody. So to combat that I want to provide people with something they can wear unapologetically that will be funny and possibly open peoples eyes about how stupid it is to be offended by everything.]

        [Here you can trully show some support to the people actually risk their lives to provide the comforts we enjoy in this Nation. Such as Military personell, Firefighters, Sheriffs, and EMS workers. I would like to add those that actually make our nation run like our farmers and ranchers that keep us fed at all times and seasons. I want to reckognize all those working in the trades like electricians, plummers, HVAC, Framers, and Subcontracters. These are the people that keep everything around us from falling apart!]
