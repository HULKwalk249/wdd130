            <h2>Toxic Maker</h2>
            <p>The creator of this training event is named Ryker Davison. Ryker grew up in a small town in Montana. His father was a farmer for a long time. When things went south with the farm Ryker's family moved to western Washington where his father built houses. After finishing Highschool Ryker served a religious mission for 2 years. Apparently he wasn't done serving because he joined the Army in 2012 and served a few months shy of 4 months. He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013. After receiving an Honorable Discharge from the Army he worked as a manager for multiple seed plants in Montana before using the GI Bill and going to school to get a degree in business management.</p>

            <h2>Why We Do This</h2>
            <p>Toxic training is a veteran owned event that is driven to take people and put them in stressfull situations to help them learn knew skills and learn that the body is not made of glass. The United States has become so soft that somehow words now hurt people. People these days seem to think a word will kill them, if things get difficult they will die, and if somebody touches them it will create a mortal wound! Here at Toxic Training we are sick of it. That is why we take people and help them learn that words don't kill, our bodies and minds are designed to do hard things, and that we are all capable of defending ourselves if you are willing to learn and take some punishment. People say that these types of activities are promoting toxic masculinity and words can be be violent. We say anybody who says this garbarge has clearly never seen real violence. This type of training saved lives during times of war. We want people who enter here to come out strong, capable, and confident enough to take on whatever life may throw out them. Life is a war looking to beat you down physically and mentally. Toxic Training gives you the tools to fight back and not only survive but thrive. War within, war without, War unending!</p>
